# Getting Started with JRo's GitHub Micro App

Hi there, if you are reading this my guess is that you work for Hotel Engine. First off, I want to say thank you for taking the time to review my project! Please feel free to play around with the app and try to break it.

A couple of notes about the code.
1. It's always important to have self-documenting code. For this project, I choose to use JS docs as my form of documentation mainly for time reasons. In past projects I have used this and also TypeScript.
2. There are a million ways to do styling for an application. This project uses both classes and styled components for styling with everything being powered by Material Design. In a larger, production application I would decide on a single pattern. 

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.\
